## Writing Scripts
To declare a variable (object in this R), You must follow this syntax:
[Object Name] <- [Object Value]

When you create a new object, it will show up in the "Environment" Tab in the Top-Right Pane (default layout.)
It will appear as a table
Ex: x <- 5
	y <- 6

If you want to clear the "Environment" tab, you can start your R Script file with "rm()." This function will clear the "Environment" tab every time the code starts, as long you have that function there. You could also use "rm()" in the "Console" for a quick "Environment" clean.
